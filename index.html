<h1>Sharlae's Web Programming Portfolio</h1>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
  <p>The idea is to utilize this website as a portfolio for the rest of this course.</p>
<h2>Why Github?</h2>
  <p>I have chosen to utilize the github platform since it is a well known within the programming community!</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Sharlae Eliza Brown. I was born on January 22nd, 2001 at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center In Torrance California. I currently reside in Virgina due to having joined the United States Air Force when I was 18. I am an Aerospace Propulsion Journeyman full time, and a computer science major with an associates degree in Avaition Maintenace Technology.</p>
<p>When I am not working or pursuing achademic studies, I like to engae in a few of my hobbies. Some of these include home improvement,cooking or baking, and working on my car. I bought my first home one year ago. Since then, I have completely remodeled my bathroom, updated my appliances, created a home gym, and am currently redecorationg my master bedroom. Now that I have given my house a home feel, I like to prepare some of my favorite dishes as a form of relaxation. The number one meal Il like to prepare is chicken tacos for myself and others. Outside of home, every now and then I add upgrades to my vehicle such as new shift boots, dash cam mirrors, and a back up camera; I have been in four car accidents making this a necessity. These are very small changes, but have made my vehicle feel more like my own.</p>
